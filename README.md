Documentation for Screen Color Detection and Key Press Script

Overview

This script is designed to continuously monitor a specified region of the screen for a particular color. When the specified color is detected within the given tolerance, the script simulates a key press. This can be useful for automation tasks where a response to a color change on the screen is needed.

Requirements

	•	Python 3.x
	•	Libraries: pyautogui, pydirectinput
	•	These can be installed via pip:

pip install pyautogui pydirectinput



Setup

No additional setup is required beyond ensuring that Python and the necessary libraries are installed.

Usage

	1.	Constants Configuration:
	•	STEAL_COLOR: RGB tuple representing the color to detect (e.g., (0, 232, 0)).
	•	SEARCH_REGION: A tuple defining the region of the screen to monitor (x, y, width, height).
	•	KEY_TO_PRESS: The key that will be simulated when the color is detected (e.g., 'd').
	•	SCAN_FREQUENCY: Time in seconds between each scan of the specified screen region.
	2.	Running the Script:
	•	Execute the script in a Python environment:

python script_name.py

	2.	
	•	The script will start monitoring the specified region for the color.
	3.	Stopping the Script:
	•	The script can be terminated by pressing Ctrl+C in the console.

Functions

search_for_color(color_rgb, tolerance=5, region=None)

Searches for a given color within a specified screen region.

Arguments

	•	color_rgb (tuple): The RGB color tuple to search for.
	•	tolerance (int, optional): Allowed variance in color. Defaults to 5.
	•	region (tuple, optional): The region of the screen to search.

Returns

	•	bool: True if color is found, False otherwise.

press_key(key, press_time=0.1)

Simulates a key press for a specified duration.

Arguments

	•	key (str): The key to press.
	•	press_time (float, optional): Duration to hold the key down. Defaults to 0.1 seconds.

Example Use Case

This script could be used in a gaming scenario where you need to press a key whenever a specific color appears in a designated area of the screen.
